makes it faster to get my videos made

start obs recording screen & camera

* one button indicates start of a take
* one button indicates end of a good take

dump to file of timestamps

use ffmpeg-python to chop up the video into slices, (zoom and crop?)

add them all to davinci timeline

either have them zoomed/cropped, but probably will be slower than having some effects predefined in davinci to do the crop and zoom and grading.
